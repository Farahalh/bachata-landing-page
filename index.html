        Bachata is a style of social dance from the Dominican Republic which is
        now danced all over the world. It is connected with bachata music. In
        partnering, the lead can decide whether to perform in open, semi-closed
        or closed position. Dance moves or step variety strongly depend on the
        music (such as the rhythms played by the different instruments),
        setting, mood, and interpretation. Unlike salsa, bachata dance does not
        usually include many turn patterns.

        The basic dance sequence is performed in a full 8-count moving within a
        square, consisting of three steps and then a tap or various forms of
        step syncopations (such as the "double step").[1][2] The tap is done on
        the opposite foot of the last step, while the next step is taken on the
        same foot as the tap. The dance direction may change after the tap or
        fourth step. Bachata can be danced on any beat of the musical phrase as
        long as the basic dance sequence (three steps and then a tap \
        syncopation) is maintained (for example, one may start on the 1st beat
        of the musical phrase, with the tap landing on the 4th beat).
